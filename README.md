# ZeroKnowledgeVoting

## Introduction
ZeroKnowledgeVoting is a demo application showcasing a zero-knowledge voting system using zk-SNARKs. It allows voters to cast votes anonymously while ensuring the integrity of the voting process. Results are displayed in real-time.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed. The demo has been tested with **Node.js v23.3.0**.
- You need wallets funded with:
  - **ACME tokens** for zkVerify operations.
  - **Sepolia ETH** for Ethereum transactions.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:zkPikachu/ZeroKnowledgeVoting.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ZeroKnowledgeVoting
   ```
3. Move to the `contracts`folder:   

 ```bash
   cd contracts
   ```
4. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file using `env.template` as an example:
     ```bash
     cp env.template .env
     ```
5. Navigate to the `src` folder and find the `zkVote.sol` smart contract. 
This contains the Solidity code for your voting Smart Contract. 

6. Visit [Remix Ethereum IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and ensure your wallet is connected to the Sepolia Testnet.

7. Copy `zkVote.sol` code and paste it into a new file in Remix.
8. Set Constructor Parameters:
In zkVote.sol, the constructor requires:
`_zkvContract`: The address of the zkVerify contract.
`_vkHash`: The verification key hash for your circuit.
These parameters are stored in your `.env` file in your project folder:

9. Deploy the Contract to sepolia and copy the deployed contract address. Make sure the Ethereum address used to deploy the contract is the one youâ€™re using for the app (`ETH_SECRET_KEY` should be the private key for that address).
10. Paste the contract address into the `.env.template` file in your app folder as `ETH_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` 

11. Move to the `app` folder:
   ```bash
   cd ../../app

   ```

12. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file using `env.template` as an example:
     ```bash
     cp env.template .env
     ```
   - Create a `.env.secrets` file using `env.secrets.template` as an example:
     ```bash
     cp env.secrets.template .env.secrets
     ```
     - In `.env.secrets`:
       - `ZKV_SEED_PHRASE`: The seed phrase of a wallet with sufficient **ACME tokens**.
       - `ETH_SECRET_KEY`: The secret key of an Ethereum wallet with sufficient **Sepolia ETH**.

13. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

14. Initialize the voting poll:
   ```bash
   npm run init-poll
   ```
   - This command registers voters from `voterRegistry.json` and generates the `voterMapping.json` file. You can vote using one of the account addresses listed in `voterRegistry.json`.

15. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

16. Open the application in your browser:
   - To cast a vote, go to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - To view voting results, go to: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

This process submits a transaction to the App Contract, including the necessary attestation details obtained from ZKVerify (such as the attestation ID and Merkle path). Upon successful submission and validation, the App Contract confirms and acknowledges that your vote has been casted.

## Usage
- **Voting:** Enter your account address (from `voterRegistry.json`) and choose a candidate to cast your vote.
- **Results:** View the real-time voting results on the results page.

## Example `.env` and `.env.secrets`

### `.env`
```plaintext
ZKV_RPC_URL="wss://testnet-rpc.zkverify.io"
ETH_RPC_URL="https://ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com"

ETH_ZKVERIFY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x209f82A06172a8d96CF2c95aD8c42316E80695c1
ETH_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x2719FB1f292C434305cefe52d82e2A53CecDcF85
```

### `.env.secrets`
```plaintext
ZKV_SEED_PHRASE="your wallet seed phrase with ACME tokens"
ETH_SECRET_KEY=your ethereum wallet private key starting with 0x
```

## Notes
- Ensure your wallets are sufficiently funded before running the application.
